bolus-morphine
==============

Honors thesis work on bolus morphine blood diffusion models
2013-2014 Honors Thesis Work Arizona State University Barrett, the Honors College 

Honors Thesis Purpose:
to contribute to a better understanding of the concentrations at the systemic level, 
specifically with respect to a CSF, and what happens when you compare an intravenous injection to a local delivery.

This model used ode15 in Matlab.  For an bolus dilivery look at equations3.m and model3.m. 
equations3.m is the function file. 
equations4.m and model4.m look at a concentration profile with dilivery to the CSF first.
